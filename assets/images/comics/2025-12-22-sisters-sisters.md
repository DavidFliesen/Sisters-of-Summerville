episode: "Sisters…Sisters"
---
Honey Bear and Bootsie Belle are going full diva in their blue dresses and feather fans, in this sassy little wink to the legendary Haynes Sisters from the holiday classic "White Christmas!" This duet sung to the Rosemary Clooney song helped inspire the Sisters of Summerville vibe in the first place. Expect sparkle, sisterly side-eye, and the kind of teamwork that only happens when treats are involved!🎶❄️
