episode: "White Christmas"
---
The Sisters may share a home, but they come from very different worlds. Honey Bear is a northern gal…replanted in the South from Indiana as a young pup. She’s convinced Christmas isn’t complete without snow, snow, SNOW! 🐶❄️

And Bootsie Belle is a Dorchester Paws rescue…a true Southern-born gal who prefers sunglasses, sunshine, and poolside vibes over frozen toes and shoveling. 😎🍹

This episode is Inspired by the holiday classic “White Christmas” because we all want the beauty of snow without the extreme cold and the work that comes with it. Wishing you a very Merry Christmas from Honey Bear & Bootsie Belle…the sassiest sisters in Summerville! 🎁 🥶⛄️
